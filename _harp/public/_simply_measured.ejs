</h5>
<p>Developed and desgined back-end platform services, Including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An Account Service, that decoupled user-related business logic from the front-end app and Salesforce APIs.  The service manged records of over 50,000 user subscription records as well as decreased response time of the application by over 50% on average, from 2 seconds to less than a second.</li>
  <li>An Event Publication Service, which enabled SimplyMeasured's first third-party partnership with Shift Marketing Cloud.  The service provided a generic interface for messaging across our platform, which enabled other core services to communicate in a scalable and isoalted manner.</li>
<p>Created an internal devleopment tool that improved the efficency of product development by extracting and transforming data in our HBase clusters to local development formats, a process that would normally take weeks was reduced to a UNIX command line that could be executed in seconds.</p>
